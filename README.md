# Kaya Reporting Dashboard

A modern Vue 3 application that simulates Kaya's AI-first reporting engine for performance marketers. This dashboard provides automated, CMS-powered views of campaign insights, performance benchmarks, and predictive signals.

## Features

- **Overview Page**: Displays a grid of client reports with modern card-based layout
- **Reusable HeroSection**: Dynamic component for displaying report details
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing data and broken images
- **Modern UI**: Clean, professional interface with hover effects and animations
- **Modal System**: Click-to-view full report details without page navigation

## Tech Stack

- **Vue 3** with Composition API
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **Vue Router** for navigation
- **Lucide Vue** for icons

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd kaya-test
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Build for production**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Preview production build**
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

## Design Decisions

### 1. **Modal vs. Routing**

I chose a modal approach for viewing individual reports because:

- Faster user experience (no page reload)
- Maintains context of the overview page
- Simpler implementation for this demo scope
- Easy to convert to routing later if needed

### 2. **Component Architecture**

- **HeroSection**: Designed as a pure, reusable component that accepts any report object
- **Error Boundaries**: Implemented image fallbacks and data validation
- **Type Safety**: Strong TypeScript interfaces for all data structures

### 3. **Styling Approach**

- **Tailwind CSS**: Chosen for rapid development and consistent design
- **Gradient Backgrounds**: Modern visual appeal with proper contrast
- **Responsive Grid**: CSS Grid with responsive breakpoints
- **Micro-interactions**: Subtle hover effects and transitions

### 4. **Data Handling**

- **Graceful Degradation**: Missing fields don't break the layout
- **Image Fallbacks**: SVG placeholders for broken images
- **Date Formatting**: Consistent date display with error handling
- **Loading States**: Skeleton loaders for better UX

## Tradeoffs Made

### Due to Time Constraints:

1. **Limited Routing**: Used modals instead of full routing system
2. **Basic State Management**: No Vuex/Pinia - simple component state
3. **Minimal Testing**: Focus on working functionality over test coverage
4. **Static Data**: JSON file instead of API integration

### Due to Scope:

1. **Hero Section Only**: Full report pages would include charts, insights, and breakdowns
2. **No Authentication**: Production would require user management
3. **Basic Search/Filter**: Could add advanced filtering and search
4. **Limited Animations**: Could enhance with more sophisticated transitions

## What I'd Improve with More Time

### Immediate Enhancements:

1. **Full Routing System**: Implement Vue Router with proper deep linking
2. **State Management**: Add Pinia for better state handling
3. **API Integration**: Replace JSON with real API endpoints
4. **Advanced Components**: Add charts, tables, and interactive elements

### Advanced Features:

1. **Search & Filtering**: Real-time search and category filtering
2. **Sorting Options**: Multiple sort criteria (date, performance, etc.)
3. **Export Functionality**: PDF/Excel export of reports
4. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live data
5. **A/B Testing**: Component variations for optimization
6. **Analytics**: User interaction tracking
7. **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support

### Technical Improvements:

1. **Performance**: Virtual scrolling for large datasets
2. **Caching**: Implement proper data caching strategies
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundary system
4. **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, and e2e tests
5. **SEO**: Meta tags and proper SSR if needed
6. **PWA Features**: Offline support and app-like experience

## Production Considerations

This application is structured to scale for production use:

- **Component Reusability**: HeroSection can be used across different report types
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage prevents runtime errors
- **Responsive Design**: Works across all device sizes
- **Error Resilience**: Handles malformed data gracefully
- **Performance**: Optimized images and lazy loading ready
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and documented code
